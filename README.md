ðŸ‘‹ Gegroet makker! Ik ben @Ojee07! This game is under MIT protection, but aside from that, feel free to do with the files as you desire I guess! Thanks GitHub! â˜º

If you're reading this there are pretty much 3 possibilies,
1: I'm updating the game, which means I'm uploading new files! (I would have likely made an announcement of this in my server if this is the case!)
2: There is something terribly wrong, which causes the entire project to fail! (If there is no message in my server of any sort of active update, please inform me!)
3: You're looking through my repository! (In which case, my first message is just for you!)
